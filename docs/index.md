features:
  - icon: 🔴
    title: AiError
    details: Semantic error types for every LLM failure mode — RateLimit, Timeout, TokenExhausted, ContentFiltered. Each carries retry metadata so callers know exactly what to do.

  - icon: 🔄
    title: RetryResult<T>
    details: Exponential backoff with jitter, built on Result<T>. Terminal errors (ContentFiltered, Unauthorized) short-circuit immediately — no wasted retries.

  - icon: ✅
    title: ValidatedResult<T>
    details: JSON parsing and domain validation in a single composable step. Parsing errors and validation failures surface as distinct, typed errors.

    linkText: ValidatedResult docs

  - icon: 🕵️
    title: AgentResult<T>
    details: Multi-step pipeline tracing with per-step timing, token counts, and error context. Full execution history as a value — no external APM required for development.

    linkText: AgentResult docs

  - icon: 🌊
    title: StreamResult
    details: Handle streaming completions without try/catch. Mid-stream errors are captured as Result<StreamError> — the partial response is preserved for debugging.

  - icon: 🔗
    title: Composable
    details: Every type integrates seamlessly with MonadicSharp pipelines via Bind, Map, and Match. Mix AI operations with your domain logic — no impedance mismatch.
